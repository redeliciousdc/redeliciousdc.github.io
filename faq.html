      <h2>Why are we a cooperative, not a nonprofit?</h2>
      <p>We believe in economic democracy—having workers own and control a business together. We don't sell food and any money we receive goes back into labor, fun ingredients, and shared assets. Our co-op structure lets us build sustainable and circular economies rooted in collective wealth.</p>

      <h2>Where are we going from here?</h2>
      <p>We hope to expand the region's feeding capacity with fruit and nut trees, mushroom logs, and eventually a public kitchen lab and cafe space in DC. We want to connect big ideas to real lives through food.</p>
